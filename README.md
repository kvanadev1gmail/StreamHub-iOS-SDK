StreamHub-iOS-SDK
=================

Use this open-source library to integrate Livefyre services into your native iOS app.  This SDK provides a thin layer for common API mechanisms and endpoints on top of the excellent AFNetworking stack.

For more information, please see the CommentStream sample app [[1]] or Livefyre HTTP API documentation [[2]].

## Integrating the SDK into your project

### As a Cocoa Pod (recommended)

The most convenient way to add StreamHub-iOS SDK to your project is to use CocoaPods.
If you don't have CocoaPods, run `gem install cocoapods` and `pod setup`.
Here is an example Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/Livefyre/cocoapods.git'
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'

platform :ios, :deployment_target => '6.0'

pod 'StreamHub-iOS-SDK', :git => 'https://github.com/Livefyre/StreamHub-iOS-SDK.git'
```

Then simply:

    pod install

This will download all the dependencies and create a file `MyApp.xcworkspace`, which you should use from now on to open your app project in Xcode. Note running `pod install` will clone `Livefyre/cocoapods.git` repo to `~/.cocoapods/repos/livefyre` directory.

### As an Xcode subproject

Alternatively, clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Livefyre/StreamHub-iOS-SDK.git

Next, add the Xcode project (LFSClient.xcodeproj) to your app as a subproject (easily done by simply dragging the LFSClient.xcodeproj file into Project Navigator pane in Xcode).

You will also need to do the same with any of the dependencies (AFNetworking [[3]], JSONKit [[4]]).

## Download everything at once (not recommended)

    cd ~/dev
    git clone https://github.com/Livefyre/StreamHub-iOS-SDK.git
    cd StreamHub-iOS-SDK
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    pod install
    cd examples/CommentStream
    pod install
    open CommentStream.xcworkspace

Note: to run tests in Xcode 6, you will need to add `$(PLATFORM_DIR)/Developer/Library/Frameworks` to `FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS` in `Pods-test-XCTest+OHHTTPStubSuiteCleanUp` pod [[5]].

You will also need `LFSTestConfig.plist` file from Livefyre which we will provide upon request.

## Xcode Documentation

You can browse the documentation online [[6]] or you can build the "Documentation" target in your Xcode (requires `appledoc` to be installed) on your system.

## Requirements

StreamHub iOS SDK versions since v0.2.0 require iOS 6.0 or higher.


## Appendix (JSON support)

For those looking at StreamHub-iOS SDK internals, please note that we use a modified version of JSONKit [[4]] as the default JSON parser (instead of Apple-provided NSJSONSerialization). We had to do this because the Apple-provided parser does not support decoding JSON files that contain integers or floating point numbers that are larger than those that can be represented by the system. Our modified version of JSONKit truncates very large numbers to corresponding system maximum, instead of throwing an exception.
